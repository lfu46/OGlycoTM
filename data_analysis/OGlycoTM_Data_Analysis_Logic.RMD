# Introduction

This document presents the data analysis workflow and results for the OGlycoTM project, which investigates O-glycosylation (O-GlcNAc and O-GalNAc modifications) in mass spectrometry proteomics data across three human cell types: **HEK293T**, **HepG2**, and **Jurkat**.

The analysis compares tunicamycin-treated (Tuni) versus control (Ctrl) conditions to understand the dynamics of O-GlcNAcylation across different cellular contexts.
