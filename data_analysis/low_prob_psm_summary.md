# Summary of Low Probability PSMs (Site Probability < 0.75)

## Table 1: Proportion of Low Probability PSMs (< 0.75)

| Cell Type | Confidence Level | Total PSM | Low Prob PSM | % Low Prob |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| HEK293T | Level1 | 622 | 0 | 0.0% |
| HEK293T | Level1b | 423 | 213 | 50.4% |
| HepG2 | Level1 | 336 | 0 | 0.0% |
| HepG2 | Level1b | 263 | 91 | 34.6% |
| Jurkat | Level1 | 400 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Jurkat | Level1b | 330 | 167 | 50.6% |

## Table 2: Impact on Sites if Low Prob PSMs (< 0.75) are Removed

- **Sites Only Low Prob (LOST)**: Sites that would be lost (no high prob PSM support)
- **Sites Also High Prob (RETAINED)**: Sites that would be retained (have high prob PSM)

| Cell Type | Sites with Low Prob PSM | Sites Only Low Prob (LOST) | Sites Also High Prob (RETAINED) |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| HEK293T | 85 | 55 | 30 |
| HepG2 | 48 | 33 | 15 |
| Jurkat | 82 | 63 | 19 |
| **Total** | **215** | **151** | **64** |

## Table 3: Summary by Confidence Level (All Cell Types)

| Confidence Level | Total PSM | Low Prob PSM | % Low Prob |
|------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Level1 | 1,358 | 0 | 0.0% |
| Level1b | 1,016 | 471 | 46.4% |
